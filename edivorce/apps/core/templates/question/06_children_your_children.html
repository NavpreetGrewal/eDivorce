                                Child support orders made in British Columbia are based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
                                These guidelines contain clear rules that courts use to set child support as well as
                                tables that list the amount of child support the payor has to pay. These amounts are based
                                on how much he or she earns and how many children the payor must support. Each province
                                has its own table; use the one for the province where the payor lives.

                    Next up, we have questions about your children. If  you and the other parent have lived together
                    with your children, generally both of you continue to be guardians after you separate. As guardians,
                    you'll need to figure out how you'll care for and make decisions about your children. That is, how
                    will you divide or share parenting responsibilities and parenting time? Even though parents share
                    these responsibilities when they're living together, the law does not assume that any particular
                    arrangement is in the children's best interests after you split up.

    <p><strong>Sole Custody Example</strong></p>
    <p>
        Maria and Pedro have decided to divorce. Their children, Christine and Manuel, are having a hard time coping
        with the idea. They are afraid of the changes it will mean in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maria and Pedro want to protect their children as much as possible. They agree that it will probably be better
        for Christine and Manuel to continue living in the family home with Maria. It is closer to their school and
        friends than the new place Pedro plans to move to. The children will spend a fair bit of time with Pedro, too,
        especially on weekends and holidays. But Maria and Pedro calculate that, over the entire year, the children will
        spend 65% of the time with Maria and 35% of the time with Pedro. This means that Maria will have sole custody
        for child support purposes, although they have decided that they will have joint custody for decision-making
        purposes. Pedro will pay support.

    <p><strong>Split Custody Example</strong></p>
    <p>
        Bill and Janet have decided to go their separate ways and get a divorce. They are having a hard time agreeing on
        the parenting arrangements for their three children. But there is one thing they do agree on—that it is important
        to put their children’s best interests first.
    </p>
    <p>
        They both realize that their oldest child, 15-year-old Marc, is particularly close to Bill. After discussing the
        issue with Marc, they all agree that it will be best for Marc to spend most of the time with his father. With
        the help of a mediator, Bill and Janet are also able to agree that the two youngest children, three-year-old
        Caroline and five-year-old Albert, will spend time mainly with Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, Marc will spend more than 60% of the time with Bill while Caroline and Albert will spend more
        than 60% of the time with Janet over the course of a year. This means that Bill and Janet will each have sole
        custody of at least one of the children. They have a split-custody arrangement.

    <p><strong>Shared Custody Example</strong></p>
    <p>
        Eight-year-old twins Malia and Emma are very worried. They have just found out that their dad, Raoul, and mom,
        Lily, have decided to divorce and live in separate homes. Malia and Emma wonder where they will live. They are
        afraid that if one of their parents lives in a different house, they will hardly ever see that parent again.
        This happened to one of their friends at school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raoul and Lily listen to their children’s concerns. They assure Malia and Emma that they both love them very
        much and will always be their parents. They also explain that the children will get to live in two houses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lily and Raoul have a number of discussions and take a close look at their family’s situation to come up with a
        plan that is workable and best for Malia and Emma. They explain to Malia and Emma that they will spend alternate
        weeks with each parent. They will spend one week with mom, and they will spend the next week with dad. The
        schedule will vary a bit sometimes. For example, in the summer, Malia and Emma will spend a complete month with
        each parent. But they should not worry. Mom and dad will work together to ensure that their decisions are in
        Malia’s and Emma’s best interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Malia and Emma spend at least 40% of the time with each parent, Raoul and Lily have a shared-custody
        arrangement for child support purposes.
