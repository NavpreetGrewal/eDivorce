                        <li>

                            parents’ incomes after the separation or divorce;

                            parents’ incomes after the separation or divorce;

    <p><strong>Undue Hardship</strong></p>
    <p>
        In any claim for hardship, the court also compares the standards of living of the two households. The court will
        refuse a claim of undue hardship if it would result in the payor's household having a higher standard of living
        than the recipient's.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p><strong>What are special and extraordinary expenses?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The child support guidelines say that each parent is required to contribute to the special or extraordinary
        expenses of raising the children (examples are listed below). These are expenses that go above and beyond what
        is covered by the child support itself. In making decisions about what to spend on these special expenses,
        consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether the expense is needed to address your child's best interests, and</li>
        <li>How reasonable the expense is, given your income and that of the other party.</li>
        <li>
            The amount that must be contributed is based on the proportionate incomes of the parents. For example, if
            the payor earns twice as much as the recipient, the payor will be required to contribute twice as much.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Either parent can claim special or extraordinary expenses. For example, if you're the payor and you're paying for
        private school for your child who isn't living with you, you may still get the other parent to contribute.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p><strong>When the table amounts might not apply</strong></p>
    <p>Judges (or masters) will consider making orders for amounts that are less than those shown in the tables if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the court agrees with the payor's claim for undue hardship (see below),</li>
        <li>the child is 19 or over (and not in school full-time),</li>
        <li>the payor is a step-parent,</li>
        <li>one parent's income is over $150,000, or</li>
        <li>one parent makes a claim for special or extraordinary expenses (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Also, children under 19 may no longer be eligible for child support if they get married or voluntarily leave
        their parents' home for reasons other than family violence or intolerable living conditions.

    <p><strong>Whose Income is Needed </strong></p>
    <p>
        If the paying parent earns more than $150,000 per year, you may need to calculate both incomes.
        The Federal Guidelines provide two options:
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the tables to determine the child support amount for the first $150,000. Then add the percentage
        listed in the tables for the portion of income over $150,000. If you choose this option, you would only need
        to calculate the paying parent’s income.
    </p>
    <p>
        or
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the tables to determine the child support amount for the first $150,000. You can then determine an
        amount for the portion of income over $150,000 by looking at the condition, means, needs and other circumstances
        of the child and the financial ability of each of you to contribute. If you choose this option, you would need
        to calculate both incomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You may need to calculate your child’s income—for example, if the child is over the age of majority and you
            are taking his or her financial means into consideration to determine a child support amount.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may need to calculate the income of every member of both households to compare the standards of living
            if either of you is claiming undue hardship.

        <p><strong>What is "undue hardship"?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The person paying or the person receiving child support can ask for a different amount than what's listed in
            the guidelines tables if that amount would cause them undue hardship. The payor may experience undue hardship
            trying to pay the child support, or the recipient may experience undue hardship trying to support the child or
            children with the amount given. The courts have said that "undue" means excessive, exceptional, or
            disproportionate. This can be a hard thing to prove. The person making the claim must report all income coming
            into their household, including any income or contribution from a new spouse or partner. This includes any
            contribution to household expenses, and any rental income, dividend income, investment income, and business
            income. If the payor makes this claim, the recipient must also provide information about their income.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to determine undue hardship</strong></p>
        <p>
            To determine undue hardship under the Federal Child Support Guidelines, you need to compare the standards of
            living in both households. To do this, you need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                calculate the income of every member of both households; adjust each person’s income according to the rules
                set out in the Federal Guidelines; and
            </li>
            <li>
                calculate the household income ratio.
            </li>
        </ul>
