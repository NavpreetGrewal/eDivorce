    <p><strong>Undue Hardship</strong></p>
    <p>
        In any claim for hardship, the court also compares the standards of living of the two households. The court will
        refuse a claim of undue hardship if it would result in the payor's household having a higher standard of living
        than the recipient's.
    </p>
    <p>

        <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/child_support.php" target="_blank">undue hardship</a>
        refer to the Family Law of B.C. website.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What are special and extraordinary expenses?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The child support guidelines say that each parent is required to contribute to the special or extraordinary
        expenses of raising the children (examples are listed below). These are expenses that go above and beyond what
        is covered by the child support itself. In making decisions about what to spend on these special expenses,
        consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether the expense is needed to address your child's best interests, and</li>
        <li>How reasonable the expense is, given your income and that of the other party.</li>
        <li>
            The amount that must be contributed is based on the proportionate incomes of the parents. For example, if
            the payor earns twice as much as the recipient, the payor will be required to contribute twice as much.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Either parent can claim special or extraordinary expenses. For example, if you're the payor and you're paying for
        private school for your child who isn't living with you, you may still get the other parent to contribute.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When the table amounts might not apply</strong></p>
    <p>Judges (or masters) will consider making orders for amounts that are less than those shown in the tables if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the court agrees with the payor's claim for undue hardship (see below),</li>
        <li>the child is 19 or over (and not in school full-time),</li>
        <li>the payor is a step-parent,</li>
        <li>one parent's income is over $150,000, or</li>
        <li>one parent makes a claim for special or extraordinary expenses (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Also, children under 19 may no longer be eligible for child support if they get married or voluntarily leave
        their parents' home for reasons other than family violence or intolerable living conditions.
