    <p><strong>What does the law mean by “best interests of the child”?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The “best interests of the child” is a legal test used to decide what would best
        protect your child’s physical, psychological, and emotional safety, security and
        well-being. To determine what is in the child’s best interests when making parenting
        arrangements, you must consider factors including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The child’s emotional health and well-being</li>
        <li>The child’s views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them</li>
        <li>The child’s relationships with parents, guardians, and other important people</li>
        <li>The history of care, and</li>
        <li>The impact of any family violence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you make an agreement about parenting arrangements after a separation, the law says
        you must only consider the child’s best interests. And if you go to court, the judge can
        only consider the child’s best interests in making parenting orders.. For more information
        on the
        <a href="http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/bestInterestsOfChild.php" target="_blank">
            best interests of the child
        </a>
        please refer to the Family Law  in B.C. website.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The benefits of using both courts (Provincial Court, Supreme Court)</strong></p>
    <p>
        In some situations, you may find it best to use both courts. You could get most of your
        orders in Provincial Court, and then just apply for your divorce order in Supreme Court.
        (You could also choose to make an agreement about parenting, support, and property and
        then just apply to the Supreme Court for a divorce.) This approach might save you money
        and time, especially if you and your spouse agree on what should be done.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, it could make things more complicated to have to deal with two
        different courts. It can also be a problem if you ask more than one court to deal with
        issues about parenting and support.
