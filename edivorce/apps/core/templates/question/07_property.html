    <p>Family property is everything either you or your spouse own together or separately on the date you separate. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the family home</li>
        <li>RRSPs</li>
        <li>investments</li>
        <li>bank accounts</li>
        <li>insurance policies</li>
        <li>pensions</li>
        <li>an interest in a business</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It doesn't matter whose name the property is in.</p>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapse_unequal_division">
        <div>
            <p>A court will divide family property or debt unequally only if it would be “significantly unfair” to divide it equally. This means that a court will not order an unequal division in most cases. The court can look at a number of factors when
                deciding whether to divide property or debt unequally.</p>
            <p>As well, a couple can divide their property or debt unequally by making an agreement.</p>

        <div>
            <p>For dividing property and debts, couples who have lived together in a marriage-like relationship for two years are treated like married couples. This means you equally share all the property you acquired during the relationship. If you bought
                the house while you were in a marriage-like relationship, it doesn't matter who paid the down payment — the house is considered family property and you'll have to divide it equally. (If either of you owned property that was bought before
                the relationship, you have to share the amount by which the value of the property increased since you started living together.)</p>
            <p>However, if applying the rule would result in significant unfairness, a judge can order a division that's not 50/50.</p>

        <p>In order to be considered a spouse for the purposes of dividing property or debt you must have lived together in a marriage-like relationship for at least two years.</p>
        <p>Under the law, the start date of a spousal relationship is the day two individuals begin living together in a marriage-like relationship, or the day they were married, whichever is first. The start date of a spousal relationship determines when
