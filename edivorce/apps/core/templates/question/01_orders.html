                    A divorce is a court order, made under the Divorce Act, that ends a marriage. Only married spouses need to get a divorce to end their relationship; unmarried spouses and other unmarried couples do not need to divorce. Their relationships are over when
                    they separate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So you do not need to ask for a legal end to the marriage (Divorce order). However, if you would like spousal support or property and debt issues addressed, you will need to ask for these orders.

                    When a couple separates, one spouse may be eligible to receive financial support from the other. This is called spousal support. Spousal support is separate and distinct from child support. Unlike child support, spousal support is not a right in every
                    case. You are entitled to spousal support in certain situations.<br /> The objectives of spousal support are to:

                    <li>Deal with any economic advantages or disadvantages a spouse may face as a result of the relationship or separation</li>
                    <li>Share the financial consequences arising from care of the children</li>
                    <li>Reduce the financial hardship a spouse will experience as a result of the separation, and</li>
                    <li>Encourage each spouse to become financially self-sufficient within a reasonable period of time.</li>

    <p>We've noticed that at this point in time you are not applying for spousal support and/or division of property, debt, or a pension. If you decide to request these items in the future there are some time limits.</p>
    <h2>Division of Property and Debts</h2>
    <p>If you were married, you must apply to divide property within two years after you get an order for divorce. If you were living in a marriage-like relationship for at least two years, you must apply within two years of the date you separated.</p>
    <h2>Spousal Support</h2>
    <p>If you were married, you must apply for spousal support under the Family Law Act within two years after you get an order for divorce. If you are applying for spousal support under the Divorce Act, you do not have a time limit.</p>
    <p>If you were unmarried, and you qualify for spousal support, you must apply within two years of the date you separated.</p>

<p>An order is the record of the judge's decision. It is filed at the court registry.</p>
<p>
    In Supreme Court, the parties involved in a case (or their lawyers) are responsible for telling the court the order(s) they want. This is done by putting the details in writing in their application and in a draft of the order to be signed by the judge
    or master. The judge or master who reviews the application will sign the order, if they approve it.
</p>
<p>Can we define "draft"? The term is referenced on Form F35 and would naturally fit in this explanation.</p>
<p>Define application<br /> An application (request) to the Court for an order or judgment which occurs during the course of a court proceeding</p>
