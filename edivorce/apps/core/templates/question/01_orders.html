                    When a couple separates, one spouse may be eligible to
                    receive financial support from the other. This is called
                    spousal support. Spousal support is separate and distinct
                    from child support. Unlike child support, spousal support
                    is not a right in every case. You are entitled to spousal
                    support in certain situations.
                <p>The objectives of spousal support are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal with any economic advantages or disadvantages a
                      spouse may face as a result of the relationship or
                      separation</li>
                    <li>Share the financial consequences arising from care of
                      the children</li>
                    <li>Reduce the financial hardship a spouse will experience
                      as a result of the separation, and</li>
                    <li>Encourage each spouse to become financially
                      self-sufficient within a reasonable period of time.</li>

            Law Act, you can get court orders or enforce an agreement in either

            <p>In some situations, you may find it best to use both courts. You

<h3>What are Orders?</h3>
<p>
    An order is the record of the judge's decision. It is filed at the court
    registry. In Supreme Court, the parties involved in a case (or their
    lawyers) are responsible for telling the court the order(s) they want.

           draft order is the outcome of what is being sought. The draft order

<h3>What does being a guardian mean?</h3>
<p>Guardianship = parental responsibilities + parenting time</p>
<p>
    Guardians are responsible for the care and upbringing of, and decision making about, their child.
    There are two parts to guardianship: parental responsibilities and parenting time.
</p>
<p>What happens when we separate?</p>
<p>
    If you and the other parent have lived together with your children, both of you continue to
    be guardians after you separate. You'll need to figure out how you you'll care for and make
    decisions about your children. That is, how will you divide or share parenting
    responsibilities and parenting time?
</p>
<p>
    Even though parents share these responsibilities when they're living together, the law does
    not assume that any particular arrangement is in the children's best interests after you
    split up. The law specifically says that courts can't assume that equal sharing of parenting
    time or equal allocation of parental responsibilities are in the children's best interests.
