                Divorce is the end of a legal marriage. To get a divorce, you must go through a legal process and get a court order that says the marriage has ended.

                        A divorce is a court order, made under the Divorce Act, that ends a marriage. Only married spouses need to get a divorce to end their relationship;
                        unmarried spouses and other unmarried couples do not need to divorce. Their relationships are over when they separate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So you do not need to ask for a legal end to the marriage (Divorce order).
                        However, if you would like spousal support or property and debt issues addressed, you will need to ask for these orders.

    <p>An order is the record of the judge's decision. It is filed at the court registry.</p>
    <p>
        In Supreme Court, the parties involved in a case (or their lawyers) are responsible for telling the court the order(s) they want.
        This is done by putting the details in writing in their application and in a draft of the order to be signed by the judge or master.
        The judge or master who reviews the application will sign the order,  if they approve it.
    </p>
    <p>Can we define "draft"?  The term is referenced on Form F35 and would naturally fit in this explanation.</p>
    <p>Define application<br />
       An application (request) to the Court for an order or judgment which occurs during the course of a court proceeding</p>
