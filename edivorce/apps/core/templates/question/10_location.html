                    Ok, we're almost done asking you questions. The last set of information that we need to know is where

                    The only way to obtain an order for divorce is by starting a court proceeding in the B.C. Supreme Court;
                    you must sue your spouse if you want to get divorced. To do this you will need to submit (file) your divorce application at a court registry

        You can file your divorce documents at any Supreme Court registry.
        Usually, people file their documents at the Supreme Court registry nearest to where they live or work
        <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/court_locations_and_contacts.aspx">(Supreme Court registry addresses).</a>
        When you go to the registry, ask any staff person to direct you to the divorce counter.
