                        When you divorce or separate from your spouse or common-law partner, there are many issues you may need work out. These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How will you take care of the children?</li>
                        <li>How will you divide property and debt?</li>
                        <li>Will one of you pay child support?</li>
                        <li>Will one of you pay spousal support?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you and your spouse can work together to reach a fair agreement, it's important that you have it written down and that both of you sign it.
