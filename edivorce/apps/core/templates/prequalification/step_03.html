                                 There is no such thing as a "legal separation." If you're married or in a common-law relationship,
                                 you become separated as soon as you and your spouse start living apart with at least one of you wanting to separate.
                                 You don't need your spouse's permission to start living separately. You can tell others that you wish to separate,
                                 but you don't have to see a lawyer, sign a document, or go to court to be separated.

                                 You might even still live in the same house to save money, but you're usually still considered separated
                                 if you don't share things like meals, a bedroom, and social activities.

                        The date you entered indicates you've been separated for less than one year You can use this online tool to start working
                        on the divorce forms, however you will not be able to file your documents at the registry until
                        the one year separation period has passed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Under the Divorce Act, a divorce may be granted on one of three grounds:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>intentional separation for more than one year</li>
                        <li>adultery</li>
                        <li>physical or mental cruelty</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Most divorces are granted on the basis of intentional separation for more than a year.
                        It's possible to get a divorce more quickly by basing it on the grounds of either adultery or physical or mental cruelty.
                        However, you must be able to prove the adultery or cruelty. It's best to talk to a lawyer before deciding to seek a divorce
                        on grounds other than separation.

                                Spouses that are separated can get back together and live together again to try and make the marriage work.
                                But within the one-year separation period, they can only live together for a total of 90 days or less.
                                If they live together for more than 90 days, the one-year period of separation starts all over again from the date of the last separation.

<p>When two people who have been living together in a marriage, or a marriage-like relationship (sometimes called a common-law relationship), decide not to live together any more, they are separated.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a "legal" separation. If you are living apart, you are separated.</p>
<p>It is possible to be separated and still living in the same home where a clear intention of a permanent separation has been communicated and acted upon.</p>

<h3>What happens if my spouse and I tried to work things out</h3>
<p>
    If you apply for a divorce on the basis of a one-year separation, you can live together for up to 90 days
    (either before or after you file the application) to try to reconcile. If things do not work out, you can continue your action for
    divorce as if you had not spent the time together.
</p>

<h3>Does being separated mean living at two different addresses?</h3>
<p>Some couples choose to separate but still live in the same house. A lawyer can tell you what factors courts may consider when they are deciding if you are separated.</p>
<p>A list of activities and behaviours that the courts consider to be indicators of a couple being separated can be found on the Legal Services Society website</p>
