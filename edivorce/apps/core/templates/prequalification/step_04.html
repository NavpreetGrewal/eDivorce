    use this online tool. So let's start by asking you a few questions to make
    sure that this website is right for your situation.</p>

    If you had children with your spouse, but the children are over
    the age of majority (19 in B.C.) and independent, they are
    no longer considered ‘children of the marriage’ under the Divorce
    Act, and you do not need to include their information in your
    divorce documents. Or, if you wish, you can name them in your
    documents, and indicate that they are 19 or over and independent,
    and no longer requiring support.</p>

            <p>
                A step-parent does not automatically become a guardian. You may apply for guardianship
                of your step-children after you separate.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have to pay child support for step-children if:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    you contributed to the child’s support for at least one year during your relationship

            <p>
                A step-parent’s responsibility to pay child support comes after the child’s parents’
                or other guardians’ responsibility. When deciding if a step-parent should pay child support,
                the court will consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the child’s standard of living when he or she lived with the step-parent, and</li>
                <li>how long they lived together</li>

                parenting time if you separate. After a child is adopted, the parents who placed

        </p>
        <p>
            Please note if you are <strong>asking for a divorce</strong>,  divorces are granted
            under the federal Divorce Act. If you are seeking a divorce, you can
            apply to the Supreme Court to settle your other family law issues,
            such as support and
            <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/family-law/parenting-apart"
               target="_blank">parenting arrangements</a> , under the Divorce Act or
            under the provincial Family Law Act. The Family Law Act is usually
            better for settling these issues because it is tailored to respond
            to the needs of families.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The benefits of using both courts</strong></p>
        <p>
            In some situations, you may find it best to use both courts. You could get
            most of your orders in Provincial Court, and then just apply for your
            divorce order in Supreme Court. (You could also choose to make an agreement
            about parenting, support, and property and then just apply to the Supreme
            Court for a divorce.) This approach might save you money and time, especially
            if you and your spouse agree on what should be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, it could make things more complicated to have to deal with
            two different courts. It can also be a problem if you ask more than one court
            to deal with issues about parenting and support.
        </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a long-term income change for the payor,</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The court can also change the order if:

                <ul>
                    <li>circumstances have changed so much that a court would make a different order now,</li>
                    <li>one party didn’t provide all the required financial information when the order was made, or</li>
                    <li>there’s important new information that wasn’t available when the first order was made.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you have taken over responsibility for the daily care of a child from the other parent
                    or guardian, you can apply to change the child support order or agreement so the other parent
