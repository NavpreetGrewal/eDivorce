    <h5><strong>*Beta Service - Joint Divorce Without Children Only</strong></h5>
    <p>
        For now, this service only handles the creation of paperwork for divorces 
        where both partners agree they want a divorce (Joint Divorce) and DO NOT 
        have any dependent children.  In the future this service will be expanded 
        to help those WITH children.
